            <p>
                The game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as "a grand culmination" 
                of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming, drawing from their 
                experiences working on Devil World and the side-scrollers Excitebike and Kung Fu.

            <p>
                Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they traverse the Mushroom
                Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from King Koopa (later named Bowser). They traverse 
                side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups 
                such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.

                Koji Kondo's soundtrack is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music 
                a centerpiece of game design.
